# spectrum
Library for colour and formatting in the terminal.

Using OCaml Format module's ["semantic tags"](https://ocaml.org/api/Format.html#tags) feature, with tags defined for named colours from the [xterm 256-color palette](https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/), as well as 24-bit colours via CSS-style hex codes.

It's inspired by the examples given in [Format Unraveled](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01503081/file/format-unraveled.pdf#page=11), a paper by Richard Bonichon & Pierre Weis, which also explains the cleverness behind OCaml's (mostly) type-safe format string system.

## Usage

The basic usage looks like:

```ocaml
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<green>%s@}\n" "Hello world ðŸ‘‹";;
```

The pattern is `@{<TAG-NAME>CONTENT@}`. So in the example above `green` is matching one of the 256 xterm [color names](https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/). Tag names are case-insensitive.

### Tags

We can have arbitrarily nested tags, e.g.:

```ocaml
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<green>%s @{<bold>%s@} %s@}\n" "Hello" "world" "I'm here";;
```

Which should look like:

Here the tag `bold` is used to output one the [ANSI style codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters). Spectrum defines tags for:

- `bold`
- `dim`
- `italic`
- `underline`
- `blink`
- `rapid-blink`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethru`

As well as the named palette colours you can directly specify an arbitrary colour using short or long CSS-style hex codes:

```ocaml
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<#f0c090>%s@}\n" "Hello world ðŸ‘‹";;
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<#f00>%s@}\n" "RED ALERT";;
```

By default we are setting the "foreground" colour, i.e. the text colour. But any colour tag can be prefixed with a foreground `fg:` or background `bg:` qualifier, e.g.:

```ocaml
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<bg:#f00>%s@}\n" "RED ALERT";;
```

Finally, Spectrum also supports compound tags in `colour:style` format, e.g.:

```ocaml
Spectrum.Printer.printf "@{<#f00:bold>%s@}\n" "RED ALERT";;
```

### Interface

As you can see in the examples above, `Spectrum.Printer.printf` works just like `Format.printf` from the [OCaml stdlib](https://ocaml.org/api/Format.html#fpp).

We also expose equivalents of `fprintf` and `eprintf`.

Under the hood all of these work via partial application, which is how Spectrum is able to support formats with arbitrary numbers of args.

However this causes a problem when we want an equivalent to `sprintf` since that has to return a value.

So far I couldn't think of a clever workaround so Spectrum provides this kludge instead:

```ocaml
let result = ref "" in
Spectrum.Printer.sprintf_into result "@{<green>%s@}\n" "Hello world ðŸ‘‹";
Format.print_string !result;
```

The `sprintf_into` method takes a `string ref` as its first arg and will update that with the result value.

## Alternatives

AFAICT the main lib for this in the OCaml world at the moment is [`ANSITerminal`](https://github.com/Chris00/ANSITerminal/). It supports more than just colour and styles, providing tools for other things you might need in a terminal app like interacting with the cursor. It doesn't use "semantic tags", but provides analogs of the `*printf` functions which now take a list of styles as the first arg, with that styling applied to the formatted string as a whole. For named colours it supports only the [basic set of eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit) i.e. those which should be supported by any terminal.

There is also [`Fmt`](https://erratique.ch/software/fmt/doc/Fmt/). I couldn't work out how to use it from reading the docs alone, at least when I first looked at it. I think it may also integrate with `Cmdliner` somehow, which could be handy. It appears to support the eight basic colours and styles and exposes a `val styled : style -> 'a t -> 'a t` signature (where `'a t` is _"the type for formatters of values of type `'a.`"_), which looks similar to ANSITerminal but only applying a single style at a time (?) i.e. no bold+red.

In other languages we have libs like [colored](https://gitlab.com/dslackw/colored) (Python) and [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) (JS) ...the latter being one of the most comprehensive I've seen.

## TODOs

- more flexible compound tags (fg+bg color, arbitrary order)
- tests and docs for exceptions, tests for all methods
- terminal capabilities detection, as per `chalk`
- auto coercion to nearest supported colour, for high res colours on unsupported terminals, as per `chalk`
